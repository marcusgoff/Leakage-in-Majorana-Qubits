# Leakage-in-Majorana-Qubits
This repository contains the MATLAB code for the numerical simulations in the paper "M. C. Goffage, A. Alase, M. C. Cassidy, S. N. Coppersmith, Leakage at Zero Temperature from Changes in Chemical Potential in Majorana Qubits."

Please note that this code uses the QPP_Library which is still work in progress. All functionality used to generate results for our papers have been tested. However, we have written this library with the intention of expanding it's functionality.
